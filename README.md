## Project Overview
Welcome to the user interface of our AI-powered Support Tickets system. This frontend application is built using the power of Next.js 13, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience. It allows users to **interact with our Python-based AI system**, which processes natural language reports of issues, organizes the data into tickets, and maintains the ticket lifecycle.

## Demo Project ðŸš€

## Key Features
- **AI Content Generation:** The system accepts natural language reports of problems with bots or orders. Then, process the input to extract **problem location**, **problem type** (software, hardware, or field) and a **summary** of the issue.
- **Support during AI Model Downtime:** We've added error handling to ensure continuous operation even when the GPT-3.5-turbo is offline or at its request limit. We support this feature by creating tickets for prompt assistance.


## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LilianaRestrepoTorres/client-support.git`
2. Add your API KEY in a `.env` file with the variable name `OPENAI_KEY`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
